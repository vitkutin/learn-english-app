# How to use?

User:

Navigate to the QUIZ-page and press BEGIN to start practising.
The app will present you with a finnish word and your job is to answer with the english equivalent.
If your answer is correct, you'll get a point! If not, you won't get one.
When the quiz is over, the app will inform you how many points you scored!

On this page you will be presented a list of the current exercises.
